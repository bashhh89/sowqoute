Field Dynamics: All fields in the templates are expected to be dynamic unless otherwise specified. If certain fields are required to be static, this must be communicated before development begins.

Data Availability: It is assumed that the required data for dynamic fields (e.g., Contact information, Deal details, etc.) will be available and correctly populated in HubSpot CRM. Missing data could lead to delays or incomplete template functionality.
Signature Functionality: Digital signatures are included in the scope, but we will use HubSpot and no 3rd party signature software.
HubSpot Property Mapping: Any new custom properties or fields in HubSpot must be set up before development to avoid delays.
Timeline and Cost Adjustments: The estimated hours are based on the assumption that there will be no significant scope changes. If additional requirements are introduced, the timeline and cost will need to be adjusted accordingly.
