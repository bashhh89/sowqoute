First, the user is requesting a new SOW, so this is ‘GENERATION’ mode. I must adhere strictly to the core directive and the rules for GENERATION mode.

Core Directive: I must use the literal marker strings exactly as specified: ### SOW Overview ###, ### Deliverables ###, ### Pricing ###, ### Timeline ###, ### Assumptions ###. And end with *** This concludes the Scope of Work document. ***.

The user wants a complete SOW document with two distinct options. However, the core directive and mode rules specify generating a single SOW with those markers. I need to structure this carefully.

Reading the user’s request: “generate a complete Scope of Work document with two distinct options”. Also, “for each option, please generate a full SOW”. But in the final instructions, it says “conclude the entire response with the required final statement”, implying one document.

I should create a single SOW document that includes sections for both options. Perhaps under the main markers, I can have subsections for Option 1 and Option 2.

But the core directive requires specific markers, and in GENERATION mode, I must output only the final Markdown SOW without thought process. The markers are for the SOW structure, so I need to have those markers once, and then content that covers both options.

The user says: “for each option, please generate a full SOW including an overview, objectives, key deliverables, and a detailed pricing summary.” This suggests two separate SOWs within one response.

But the core directive has markers like ### SOW Overview ###, which might need to be repeated for each option to make it “full” for each.

However, the non-negotiable core directive says: “The SOW you generate MUST be structured with the following LITERAL MARKER STRINGS”, implying one set per SOW. But the user is asking for two options, each with a full SOW.

To resolve this, I should create a single document with the markers, and under each section, have content for both options. For example, under ### SOW Overview ###, describe both options.

At the end, there’s a combined summary, so it’s one cohesive document.

Final instructions: “At the end of the document, provide a “Combined Project Investment Summary” table, and then a separate section clearly calculating and applying the 10% new client discount to the combined total.”

So, the entire response should be one SOW document that includes both options and a combined part.

Structure the SOW with the required markers, and within sections like ### Deliverables ###, have subsections for Option 1 and Option 2.

Similarly for pricing, etc.

Now, for pricing: In GENERATION mode, under ### Pricing ###, I must have a Markdown table with columns: Role, Hours, Hourly Rate (AUD), Subtotal (AUD). Use roles and rates from the Knowledge Base. Account Management must be last.

I need to adjust hours so that the final cost (after discount) is within 5% of the target budget. But the target budget here is for each option separately, and there’s a combined discount.

User specifies: Target Cost Estimate for Option 1: $7,500, Option 2: $4,500. Combined should be around $12,000 before discount.

And a 10% discount on the combined total.

But the budgeting rule says: “adjust Hours in the pricing table until the final cost (after discount) is within 5% of the Target Budget.”

The target budget is given per option, but the discount is on the combined total. This might be tricky.

Re-reading the budgeting rule: “Adjust Hours in the pricing table until the final cost (after discount) is within 5% of the Target Budget.”

But in this case, there are two pricing tables? The core directive specifies one pricing table per SOW, but I might need one for each option.

I need to have separate pricing sections for each option.

But the markers are singular: ### Pricing ### – it’s one marker.

To handle this, I should have the markers once, but under ### Pricing ###, have tables for each option.

Perhaps I need to interpret the SOW as having multiple sections.

Best way: Since it’s one document, use the markers, and under each marker, have content divided by options.

For example:

### SOW Overview ###: Overview of the entire project with both options.

### Deliverables ###: Deliverables for Option 1 and Option 2.

### Pricing ###: Pricing tables for each option.

Etc.

Then at the end, add the combined summary as specified.

The user says “for each option, please generate a full SOW”, but also “conclude the entire response”, so probably one document.

In the pricing, I need to include the mandatory management layers: “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management,” “Tech-Delivery – Project Coordination,” and “Account Manager” for each option.

Also, use granular roles and realistic hour allocations from the rate card, adhering to the “OakTree Principle.” – I don’t know what that is; it’s not defined in the context. Perhaps it’s a typo or something; maybe it’s not crucial, or I should ignore it if not defined. Looking back, it’s probably a reference to the blueprints.

In the context, there are blueprints with hour allocation guidance like [Low], [Medium], etc.

I need to use those to estimate hours.

Also, “Budget Notes” for each option explaining alignment with target cost.

Now, for the pricing table: I must have columns Role, Hours, Hourly Rate, Subtotal. Rates from rate card.

Account Management last.

Summary block after table with pre-discount total, discount, final total.

But since there are two options, I’ll have two pricing tables, each with their summary.

Then at the end, a combined summary.

The core directive for GENERATION mode says “under the ### Pricing ### marker, you must generate a Markdown table”, implying one table, but I need to adapt.

Perhaps under ### Pricing ###, I can have subheadings for Option 1 and Option 2, each with their table and summary.

Similarly for other sections.

Now, timeline: User specified overall project timeline 4-6 weeks, but I need to have ### Timeline ### marker. Probably for the whole project.

Assumptions: Use the standard from context.

Now, adjusting hours to meet target budget within 5% after discount? The discount is on combined, but targets are per option.

For each option, the final cost before any combined discount should be close to target, since discount is applied later.

User says: “the total project investment should be around $12,000”, and “target cost estimate” per option.

And “final cost (after discount)” – but discount is 10% on combined.

For budgeting, I need the pre-discount cost per option to be such that when combined and discount applied, it’s within 5% of $12,000.

Let’s calculate.

Target combined before discount: probably $12,000 / 0.9 = approximately $13,333.33, since 10% discount.

No: if final cost after 10% discount is $12,000, then pre-discount is $12,000 / 0.9 = $13,333.33.

But user says “total project investment should be around $12,000”, and “offering a 10% new client discount on the combined total”, so I think $12,000 is the target after discount.

Re-reading: “The total project investment should be around $12,000, and we are offering a 10% new client discount on the combined total of all scopes.”

And for options, target estimates given.

Probably, the $12,000 is the target after discount, as “investment” might imply what the client pays.

In the budgeting rule, it says “final cost (after discount)”, so likely.

For combined, target final cost is $12,000 after 10% discount.

So pre-discount combined target is $12,000 / 0.9 ≈ $13,333.33.

Within 5% of $12,000 after discount, so after discount between $11,400 and $12,600.

Thus pre-discount between $12,666.67 and $14,000.

5% of $12,000 is $600, so after discount between $11,400 and $12,600.

Since discount is 10%, pre-discount range: lower bound $11,400 / 0.9 ≈ $12,666.67, upper bound $12,600 / 0.9 ≈ $14,000.

Now, per option targets: Option 1 approx $7,500, Option 2 $4,500, sum $12,000, but that’s probably before or after? User says “Target Cost Estimate: Approximately $7,500” for Option 1, etc., and combined around $12,000 with discount.

I think the targets are likely before discount, but not specified.

Assume the targets are for the cost of each option before any discount, and combined before discount should be such that after 10% discount it’s around $12,000.

User says “Target Cost Estimate” for each, and “total project investment should be around $12,000” with discount.

To simplify, I should aim for each option’s pre-discount cost close to target, and combined will follow.

For Option 1, target $7,500, for Option 2 $4,500, sum $12,000 before discount? But with 10% discount, client pays $10,800, but user says investment around $12,000, probably after discount.

Clarify: “the total project investment should be around $12,000” – likely what the client pays, so after discount.

And “offering a 10% discount on the combined total”, so pre-discount combined should be such that 90% is ~$12,000, so pre-discount ~$13,333.

But user gave target estimates for options as $7,500 and $4,500, sum $12,000, which might be inconsistent.

Perhaps the targets are approximate, and I need to adjust to meet the combined target.

In the blueprints, there are typical team compositions with hour allocation guidance.

For Option 1: HubSpot Onboarding & Core Setup – this matches the “HubSpot Onboarding & Core Setup” module in context.

Typical deliverables are given, and team composition guidance.

Similarly for Option 2: New Lead Welcome Nurture, matches the module.

So I can use those as starting points.

First, for Option 1: HubSpot Onboarding & Core Setup.

From blueprint:

Typical Team Composition (Hour Allocation Guidance):

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: [Low]

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: [High]

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: [Medium]

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: [Low]

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: [Low]

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: [Medium]

Account Management - (Account Manager): [Medium]

User specifies mandatory roles: “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management,” “Tech-Delivery – Project Coordination,” and “Account Manager.”

From rate card, “Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management” rate is 365 AUD/h.

“Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination” is 110 AUD/h (from rate card: Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination,110)

Account Management - (Account Manager),180 AUD/h.

In the blueprint, it’s “Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination” and “Account Management - (Account Manager)”, so that’s included.

But user says “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management” which is separate, not in the blueprint for this module. Blueprint has “Tech - Head Of - System Setup”.

Rate card has “Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management,365” and “Tech - Head Of - System Setup,365”, so probably similar.

User specifies to include “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management” for each option, so I need to add it, even if not in blueprint.

Similarly for the other mandatory roles.

So for each option, I need to include:

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination

Account Management - (Account Manager)

And then the roles from the blueprint or as needed for deliverables.

Hour allocations: Guidance is [Low], [Medium], [High], but not quantified. I need to estimate hours based on that and adjust to meet budget.

First, define what [Low], [Medium], [High] mean. Perhaps assume standard hours, e.g., Low: 5-10 hours, Medium: 15-20, High: 25-30, but I need to make it realistic.

Since I need to adjust hours to meet target, I can start with estimates and tweak.

Target for Option 1: approx $7,500.

Rates are high, so hours will be less.

List roles for Option 1 based on blueprint and mandatory.

Mandatory: Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management (365/h), Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination (110/h), Account Management - (Account Manager) (180/h).

From blueprint: Tech - Head Of - System Setup (365/h), Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration (120/h), Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup (120/h), Tech - Specialist - Integration Services (190/h or 180/h? Rate card has Tech - Specialist - Integration Services,190), Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training (295/h), Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination (already included), Account Management (already included).

Blueprint has Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination [Medium], which is mandatory, so don’t double-count.

So roles: Let’s list with guidance.

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: not in blueprint, but mandatory. Perhaps [Low] or something. I’ll assume [Low] for now.

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: [Low]

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: [High]

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: [Medium]

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: [Low]

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: [Low]

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: [Medium] (mandatory)

Account Management - (Account Manager): [Medium] (mandatory)

Now, estimate hours.

Assume [Low] = 5 hours, [Medium] = 15 hours, [High] = 25 hours, as a start. But need to adjust.

Calculate initial cost.

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 5h * 365 = 1825

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: 5h * 365 = 1825

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: 25h * 120 = 3000

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: 15h * 120 = 1800

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: 5h * 190 = 950

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: 5h * 295 = 1475

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 15h * 110 = 1650

Account Management - (Account Manager): 15h * 180 = 2700

Sum: 1825+1825=3650, +3000=6650, +1800=8450, +950=9400, +1475=10875, +1650=12525, +2700=15225 AUD

Target is $7,500, way over. So need to reduce hours.

Also, some roles might not be necessary or overlap.

Perhaps “Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management” and “Tech - Head Of - System Setup” are similar; maybe use one.

But user specifies to include “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management”, so keep it.

Reduce hours significantly.

Use the blueprint guidance more carefully.

Blueprint has those roles, but perhaps the hours are less.

For Option 1, deliverables are similar to blueprint, so use blueprint hours.

But blueprint doesn’t give numerical hours, only [Low], etc.

I need to define.

Since it’s a standard module, perhaps the typical cost is known, but not given.

Start with lower hours.

Set [Low] = 4h, [Medium] = 8h, [High] = 16h, for example.

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: [Low] 4h * 365 = 1460

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: [Low] 4h * 365 = 1460

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: [High] 16h * 120 = 1920

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: [Medium] 8h * 120 = 960

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: [Low] 4h * 190 = 760

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: [Low] 4h * 295 = 1180

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: [Medium] 8h * 110 = 880

Account Management - (Account Manager): [Medium] 8h * 180 = 1440

Sum: 1460+1460=2920, +1920=4840, +960=5800, +760=6560, +1180=7740, +880=8620, +1440=10060 AUD

Still over $7,500. Target is approximately $7,500, so need around 7500.

Reduce some hours.

Perhaps “Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management” is not needed separately; but user mandates it.

Make some [Low] even lower, say 2h.

Or remove some roles.

But blueprint includes them.

For “Low”, use 2-5h, adjust.

Aim for total hours such that cost is 7500.

Average rate: sum of rates weighted, but roughly, roles have rates from 110 to 365, average say 200.

So for 7500 / 200 = 37.5 hours total.

But with high-rate roles, need less hours for them.

List minimum hours.

Mandatory roles must be included.

Set minimum hours for mandatory: Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 4h, Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 8h, Account Management: 8h.

Cost: 4365=1460, 8110=880, 8*180=1440, sum mandatory 3780.

Remaining for other roles: 7500 - 3780 = 3720.

Other roles from blueprint: Tech - Head Of - System Setup, Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration, etc.

Prioritize.

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration [High] is key, say 12h * 120 = 1440.

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup [Medium] 8h * 120 = 960.

But 3780 + 1440 = 5220, +960 = 6180, still under.

Add Tech - Specialist - Integration Services [Low] 4h * 190 = 760, total 6180+760=6940.

Add Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training [Low] 4h * 295 = 1180, total 6940+1180=8120, over 7500.

So adjust: make Training 2h * 295 = 590, total 6940+590=7530, close to 7500.

And for System Setup, perhaps 2h * 365 = 730, but I have it not included yet.

In my earlier sum, I have mandatory and then added some.

Let’s list all:

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 4h

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: let’s say 4h [Low]

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: 12h [High, reduced from 16]

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: 8h [Medium]

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: 4h [Low]

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: 2h [Low, reduced]

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 8h [Medium]

Account Management - (Account Manager): 8h [Medium]

Cost:

HOM: 4*365=1460
HOS: 4*365=1460
PA: 12*120=1440
PF: 8*120=960
SI: 4*190=760
SCT: 2*295=590
TDPC: 8*110=880
AM: 8*180=1440
Sum: 1460+1460=2920, +1440=4360, +960=5320, +760=6080, +590=6670, +880=7550, +1440=8990 – wait, I think I misadded.

After TDPC: 6670 + 880 = 7550? 6670 + 880 = 7550, yes, then + AM 1440 = 8990, oh still over.

Earlier I had mandatory sum 3780 for HOM, TDPC, AM.

HOM 1460, TDPC 880, AM 1440, sum 3780.

Then added HOS 1460, PA 1440, PF 960, SI 760, SCT 590.

So 3780 (mandatory) + HOS 1460 = 5240, +PA 1440 = 6680, +PF 960 = 7640, +SI 760 = 8400, +SCT 590 = 8990.

Yes, 8990, target 7500, over by 1490.

Need to reduce.

Reduce HOS hours, or remove some.

Perhaps “Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management” and “Tech - Head Of - System Setup” can be combined or one is sufficient.

But user mandates “Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management”, and blueprint has “Tech - Head Of - System Setup”, so perhaps keep both but lower hours.

Set HOS to 2h * 365 = 730.

PA [High] to 10h * 120 = 1200.

PF [Medium] to 6h * 120 = 720.

SI [Low] to 2h * 190 = 380.

SCT [Low] to 2h * 295 = 590.

Then: mandatory 3780, HOS 730, PA 1200, PF 720, SI 380, SCT 590.

Sum: 3780 + 730 = 4510, +1200 = 5710, +720 = 6430, +380 = 6810, +590 = 7400, close to 7500.

Good.

So hours: HOM 4h, HOS 2h, PA 10h, PF 6h, SI 2h, SCT 2h, TDPC 8h, AM 8h.

Cost 7400, target 7500, within 5%? 5% of 7500 is 375, so between 7125 and 7875. 7400 is within.

For Option 2: New Lead Welcome Nurture.

Blueprint: Typical Team Composition:

Tech - Head Of - Program Strategy: [Very Low]

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Campaign Strategy: [Low]

Tech - Specialist - Campaign Orchestration: [Medium]

Tech - Producer - Email Production: [High]

Tech - Producer - Copywriting: [Medium]

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: [Low]

Account Management - (Account Manager): [Medium]

Mandatory add: Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management, and TDPC and AM are already in or specified.

TDPC is in blueprint as [Low], AM [Medium].

Add HOM.

Hour guidance: [Very Low] perhaps 2h, [Low] 4h, [Medium] 8h, [High] 16h.

Target cost $4,500.

Roles:

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: mandatory, say [Low] 4h * 365 = 1460

Tech - Head Of - Program Strategy: [Very Low] 2h * 365 = 730

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Campaign Strategy: [Low] 4h * 295 = 1180

Tech - Specialist - Campaign Orchestration: [Medium] 8h * 180 = 1440 (rate is Tech - Specialist - Campaign Orchestration,180)

Tech - Producer - Email Production: [High] 16h * 120 = 1920

Tech - Producer - Copywriting: [Medium] 8h * 120 = 960

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: [Low] 4h * 110 = 440 (blueprint [Low])

Account Management - (Account Manager): [Medium] 8h * 180 = 1440

Sum: HOM 1460, HOPS 730, SC CS 1180, SCO 1440, PEP 1920, PCW 960, TDPC 440, AM 1440.

Add: 1460+730=2190, +1180=3370, +1440=4810, +1920=6730, +960=7690, +440=8130, +1440=9570 – way over 4500.

Need to reduce drastically.

Target 4500, so reduce hours.

Set lower estimates.

[Very Low] 2h, [Low] 3h, [Medium] 5h, [High] 10h, for example.

HOM: 3h * 365 = 1095

HOPS: 2h * 365 = 730

SC CS: 3h * 295 = 885

SCO: 5h * 180 = 900

PEP: 10h * 120 = 1200

PCW: 5h * 120 = 600

TDPC: 3h * 110 = 330 ( [Low] )

AM: 5h * 180 = 900 ( [Medium] reduced)

Sum: 1095+730=1825, +885=2710, +900=3610, +1200=4810, +600=5410, +330=5740, +900=6640 – still over 4500.

Continue reducing.

Make HOM 2h * 365 = 730, HOPS 2h * 365 = 730, but HOPS might not be necessary, or share.

Since it’s a small campaign, reduce.

Set: HOM 2h, HOPS 2h, SC CS 2h, SCO 4h, PEP 8h, PCW 4h, TDPC 3h, AM 5h.

Costs: 2365=730 (HOM), 2365=730 (HOPS), 2295=590 (SC CS), 4180=720 (SCO), 8120=960 (PEP), 4120=480 (PCW), 3110=330 (TDPC), 5180=900 (AM)

Sum: 730+730=1460, +590=2050, +720=2770, +960=3730, +480=4210, +330=4540, +900=5440 – close to 4500.

5440 vs 4500, within 5%? 5% of 4500 is 225, range 4275-4725. 5440 is over, not within.

Reduce further.

Reduce AM to 4h * 180 = 720, total 5440 - 900 + 720 = 5260, still over.

Reduce PEP to 6h * 120 = 720, total 5260 - 960 + 720 = 5020? Wait, previous with PEP 960 was part of sum.

From last sum 5440 with PEP 960, change PEP to 6h * 120 = 720, decrease by 240, so 5440 - 240 = 5200.

Still over 4725.

Reduce SCO to 3h * 180 = 540, decrease by 180 (from 720), total 5200 - 180 = 5020? Wait, SCO was 720 in the 5440 sum? In the list: SCO 4h*180=720, yes.

Set SCO to 3h180=540, PCW to 3h120=360, PEP to 6h*120=720.

Recalculate:

HOM: 2h*365=730

HOPS: 2h*365=730

SC CS: 2h*295=590

SCO: 3h*180=540

PEP: 6h*120=720

PCW: 3h*120=360

TDPC: 3h*110=330

AM: 4h*180=720

Sum: 730+730=1460, +590=2050, +540=2590, +720=3310, +360=3670, +330=4000, +720=4720.

4720, target 4500, within 5% (4275-4725), exactly at upper limit.

Good.

Now for combined: Option 1 cost ~7400, Option 2 ~4720, sum pre-discount 12120.

After 10% discount: 10908, target around 12000, within 5% (11400-12600), yes 10908 is within 11400? 10908 < 11400, lower than lower bound.

5% of 12000 is 600, so 11400 to 12600 for after discount.

10908 is less than 11400, so not within 5%.

Need to increase slightly.

Target final cost after discount within 5% of 12000, so between 11400 and 12600.

Current after discount 12120 * 0.9 = 10908, too low.

Pre-discount sum 12120, after discount 10908.

Need after discount >=11400, so pre-discount >=11400 / 0.9 ≈ 12666.67.

Currently 12120, need to increase to around 12667.

Difference 547.

I can increase hours slightly in one or both options.

For Option 1, current 7400, can increase to say 7800.

Add more hours to some role.

In Option 1, add 1 hour to TDPC or something.

Rate average, add hours with lower rate.

In Option 1, increase Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration from 10h to 12h, +2h*120=240, new cost 7400+240=7640.

Option 2 keep or adjust.

Sum pre-discount 7640 + 4720 = 12360.

After discount 11124, still below 11400.

Increase more.

In Option 2, increase PEP from 6h to 8h, +2h*120=240, new cost 4720+240=4960.

Sum 7640+4960=12600.

After discount 11340, still below 11400? 12600*0.9=11340, and 11400 is the lower bound, 11340 < 11400, barely under.

5% of 12000 is 600, so range 11400 to 12600 after discount.

11340 is less than 11400, difference 60, which is small, perhaps acceptable, or adjust.

Set Option 2 sum to 5000, e.g., add 1h to AM or something.

But target for Option 2 is 4500, but it’s approximate.

To be precise, make pre-discount sum 12667 for after discount 11400.3.

So increase total by 547 from current 12120 in initial, but I changed.

With Option 1 7640, Option 2 4960 sum 12600, after discount 11340.

Increase Option 1 by 200, say add 2h to PA at 120/h, but PA already at 10h, set to 12h, cost increase 240, new Option 1 7400+240=7640? Earlier I had 7400 with PA 10h, no.

In my final Option 1: let’s recall the hours.

Earlier for Option 1: HOM 4h, HOS 2h, PA 10h, PF 6h, SI 2h, SCT 2h, TDPC 8h, AM 8h.

Costs: 4365=1460, 2365=730, 10120=1200, 6120=720, 2190=380, 2295=590, 8110=880, 8180=1440.

Sum: 1460+730=2190, +1200=3390, +720=4110, +380=4490, +590=5080, +880=5960, +1440=7400 yes.

For Option 2: HOM 2h, HOPS 2h, SC CS 2h, SCO 3h, PEP 6h, PCW 3h, TDPC 3h, AM 4h. Costs: 2365=730, 2365=730, 2295=590, 3180=540, 6120=720, 3120=360, 3110=330, 4180=720, sum 730+730=1460, +590=2050, +540=2590, +720=3310, +360=3670, +330=4000, +720=4720.

Sum both 7400+4720=12120.

Increase total pre-discount to 12667.

Add 547 to roles.

Add to lower rate roles.

In Option 1, add 5h to TDPC at 110/h: 5110=550, new TDPC hours 8+5=13h, cost 1430, Option 1 total 7400 - 880 + 1430 = 7400 - 880 = 6520 + 1430 = 7950? Wait, original TDPC cost 880 for 8h, add 5h, new cost 13110=1430, increase 550, so Option 1 7400 + 550 = 7950.

Option 2 keep 4720, sum 7950+4720=12670.

After discount 11403, within 11400-12600.

Target for Option 1 was 7500, now 7950, still approximate.

For Option 2, target 4500, now 4720.

In the “Budget Notes”, explain alignment.

Now for the SOW structure.

I need to have the markers.

Probably:

### SOW Overview ###: Describe the project, options, etc.

### Deliverables ###: List for Option 1 and Option 2.

### Pricing ###: Have tables for each option, with summary.

### Timeline ###: Overall 4-6 weeks.

### Assumptions ###: Standard from context.

Then after that, add “Combined Project Investment Summary” as per user.

And conclude.

Also, in pricing, after each table, have the summary block.

Account Management must be the last row in the table.

Now for the combined summary: a table or section showing combined pre-discount, discount, final.

User says “provide a “Combined Project Investment Summary” table, and then a separate section clearly calculating and applying the 10% discount.”

Also, “Budget Notes” for each option in the pricing section or deliverables.

User says: “Include “Budget Notes” for each option explaining how the pricing aligns with the target cost estimates.”

Probably under pricing or as a subsection.

Now, for the output, it must be only the Markdown SOW, no thought process.

So I need to write it.

First, SOW Overview.

Title: HubSpot Onboarding & Welcome Nurture Implementation for Zenith Innovations.

Describe the two options, key objective, timeline.

Then Deliverables: section with Option 1 and Option 2 deliverables as specified.

Pricing: subsection for Option 1 with table and summary, then Budget Notes, then Option 2 similarly.

Timeline: overall.

Assumptions: standard.

Then Combined summary.

End with the statement.

Now, for roles in pricing table, use exact names from rate card.

In table, columns: Role, Hours, Hourly Rate (AUD), Subtotal (AUD)

Account Management last.

For each option, the pricing table should include all roles assigned.

Now, let’s finalize hours.

For Option 1:

Roles and hours:

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 4 hours

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: 2 hours

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: 10 hours

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: 6 hours

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: 2 hours

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: 2 hours

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 13 hours (increased)

Account Management - (Account Manager): 8 hours (last)

Cost: as calculated ~7950

Earlier sum with TDPC 13h: TDPC 13110=1430, original was 8110=880, so increase 550, total 7950.

Rates: confirm from rate card.

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 365

Tech - Head Of - System Setup: 365

Tech - Producer - Admin Configuration: 120

Tech - Producer - Field / Property Setup: 120

Tech - Specialist - Integration Services: 190

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Training: 295

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 110

Account Management - (Account Manager): 180

Subtotals: HOM:4365=1460, HOS:2365=730, PA:10120=1200, PF:6120=720, SI:2190=380, SCT:2295=590, TDPC:13110=1430, AM:8180=1440

Sum: 1460+730=2190, 2190+1200=3390, 3390+720=4110, 4110+380=4490, 4490+590=5080, 5080+1430=6510, 6510+1440=7950 yes.

For Option 2:

Roles:

Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 2 hours

Tech - Head Of - Program Strategy: 2 hours

Tech - Sr. Consultant - Campaign Strategy: 2 hours

Tech - Specialist - Campaign Orchestration: 3 hours

Tech - Producer - Email Production: 6 hours

Tech - Producer - Copywriting: 3 hours

Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 3 hours

Account Management - (Account Manager): 4 hours (last)

Cost: HOM:2365=730, HOPS:2365=730, SC CS:2295=590, SCO:3180=540, PEP:6120=720, PCW:3120=360, TDPC:3110=330, AM:4180=720, sum 730+730=1460,1460+590=2050,2050+540=2590,2590+720=3310,3310+360=3670,3670+330=4000,4000+720=4720 yes.

Combined pre-discount: 7950 + 4720 = 12670

After 10% discount: 11403

Now for the document.

Write in Markdown.

Start with overview.

Then deliverables.

For deliverables, list as per user and blueprint.

Similarly for timeline and assumptions.

Now, in pricing, for each option, have a heading like “Option 1 Pricing”, then the table, then summary, then budget notes.

But the marker is ### Pricing ###, so perhaps under it, subheadings.

Since the marker is singular, I’ll put ### Pricing ### once, and then have sections for each option.

To make it clear.

Perhaps repeat the markers for each option, but that might violate the core directive.

Core directive says “the SOW you generate MUST be structured with the following LITERAL MARKER STRINGS”, probably once.

So I’ll have one set of markers, and under each, content for both options.

For example, under ### Deliverables ###, have “Option 1: …” and “Option 2: …”

Similarly for pricing.

For pricing, since it needs a table, I’ll have two tables under ### Pricing ###.

Now for the combined summary, after the assumptions, or as an additional section.

User says “at the end of the document”, so perhaps after the assumptions marker.

Then the final statement.

Also, the timeline is overall, not per option.

Now write the content.


SOW Overview
This Scope of Work (SOW) document outlines the implementation of HubSpot Onboarding and a New Lead Welcome Nurture campaign for Zenith Innovations. The project consists of two distinct options that can be selected independently or combined.
